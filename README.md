## Installation
---
### Importing API hash and keys

- You should get **YOUR OWN API KEY AND HASH** here: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id and create a file called `API_KEYS` in the source root directory.

- Also you should get **YOUR OWN MAPS API KEY** here: https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials and add it to this file.

- And you need to generate **SIGNING KEY**: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#generate-key

  

The file content should look like this:

```
APP_ID = 123456
APP_HASH = abcdef0123456789 (32 chars)
MAPS_V2_API = abcdef01234567-abcdef012345678910111213
SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = A1BcDEFHJ2KLMn3oP
SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS = abcdefghjklm
SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD = Z9yXDEFHJ6KRqn7oP
```
